The web page language for displaying is: 

- Not determined by your operating system display language.
- Not determined by your browser display language.
- Not determined by the HTTP header Accept-Language.

The web page language for display is determined by the **preferred language** of your browser. The preferred language list of your browser is the same as your operating system display language or browser display language. But you can set to add your custom preferred language and move it to the top of the list.

**Chrome**

Chrome settings --> Advanced --> Languages --> Order languages based on your preference --> Add languages --> Move your preferred language for displaying to the top.

**Firefox**

Options --> General --> Language and Appearance --> Language --> Choose your preferred language for displaying pages --> Choose --> Add your language --> Move your preferred language for displaying to the top.
