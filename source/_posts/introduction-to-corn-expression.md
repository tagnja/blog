## Introduction

`cron` is a UNIX tool that has been around for a long time, so its scheduling capabilities are powerful and proven.

> The software utility **cron** also known as **cron job** is a time-based [job scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler) in [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) computer [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Users that set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script)) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. It typically automates system maintenance or administration—though its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) and downloading [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) at regular intervals. The origin of the name *cron* is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος ([chronos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos)).

> Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks. Scheduling one-time tasks can be accomplished using the associated [*at*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_(command)) utility.

## Format

A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. 

```
second, minute, hour, day of month, month, day(s) of week
```

Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:

| Field Name   | Mandatory | Allowed Values   | Allowed Special Characters |
| :----------- | :-------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| Seconds      | YES       | 0-59             | , - * /                    |
| Minutes      | YES       | 0-59             | , - * /                    |
| Hours        | YES       | 0-23             | , - * /                    |
| Day of month | YES       | 1-31             | , - * ? / L W              |
| Month        | YES       | 1-12 or JAN-DEC  | , - * /                    |
| Day of week  | YES       | 1-7 or SUN-SAT   | , - * ? / L #              |
| Year         | NO        | empty, 1970-2099 | , - * /                    |

So cron expressions can be as simple as this: `* * * * ? *`

or more complex, like this: `0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010`

## Special characters

- `*` (*“all values”*) - used to select all values within a field. For example, “*****” in the minute field means *“every minute”*.
- `?` (*“no specific value”*) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don’t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put “10” in the day-of-month field, and “?” in the day-of-week field.

> Note: '?' can only be specfied for Day-of-Month or Day-of-Week.

- `-` - used to specify ranges. For example, “10-12” in the hour field means *“the hours 10, 11 and 12”*.
- `,` - used to specify additional values. For example, “MON,WED,FRI” in the day-of-week field means *“the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday”*.
- `/` - used to specify increments. For example, “0/15” in the seconds field means *“the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45”*. And “5/15” in the seconds field means *“the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50”*. You can also specify ‘/’ after the ‘**’ character - in this case ‘**’ is equivalent to having ‘0’ before the ‘/’. ‘1/3’ in the day-of-month field means *“fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month”*.
- `L` (*“last”*) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For example, the value “L” in the day-of-month field means *“the last day of the month”* - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means “7” or “SAT”. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means *“the last xxx day of the month”* - for example “6L” means *“the last friday of the month”*. You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as “L-3” which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month. *When using the ‘L’ option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you’ll get confusing/unexpected results.*
- `W` (*“weekday”*) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify “15W” as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: *“the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month”*. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify “1W” as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not ‘jump’ over the boundary of a month’s days. The ‘W’ character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

> *The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which translates to \*"last weekday of the month"\*.*

- `#` - used to specify “the nth” XXX day of the month. For example, the value of “6#3” in the day-of-week field means *“the third Friday of the month”* (day 6 = Friday and “#3” = the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: “2#1” = the first Monday of the month and “4#5” = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify “#5” and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.

> *The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive.* `MON` *is the same as* `mon`.
